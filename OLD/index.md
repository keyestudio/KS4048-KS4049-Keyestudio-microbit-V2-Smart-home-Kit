## Expansion Board

![Expansion Board](img/Expansion Board.png)

### Description

In the education market, micro:bit control boards are becoming increasingly popular. However, a single micro:bit board is not easily tested against other sensors. We specially designed this HolaSmart expansion board for the micro:bit.

The sensor expansion board splits all I/O ports into 3-PIN interfaces (GND, VCC, Signal) for easy connection to the micro:bit control board and other sensor modules.

In addition, it extends some commonly used serial communication interfaces to pins or female headers with pin spacing of 2.54mm, such as I2C and SPI communication pins. Therefore, this expansion board enables communication between the micro:bit board and other communication devices.

You can power the micro:bit board through the yellow DC jack (DC 7-9V) or micro USB port (DC 5V) on the expansion board.

When powering the sensor, you can select the power supply voltage of 3.3V or 5V through the jumper cap V1 and V2.

**ATTENTION:**

**When a external sensors is connected to the expansion board, the working current of the AMS1117-3.3V and NCP1117ST50T3G chips is too large so is easy to heat. Special care should be taken to avoid contact with the two chips to avoid burning out.**



### Features

\- Input voltage: Black DC jack (DC 7-9V) or micro USB interface (DC 5V)

\- Output voltage: 3.3V or 5V via jumper cap V1/V2

\- Comes with power indicator

\- Split the PIO port of the micro:bit into a 3-pin interface

\- Serial communication pin

\- I2C communication pin

\- SPI communication pin

\- Overall dimensions: 65mm x58mm x12mm

\- Weight: 31 g
